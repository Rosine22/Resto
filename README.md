### **Week 2 Assignment: Dream Restaurant Website with Advanced CSS**

**Objective:**

This assignment challenges you to create an enticing website for your dream restaurant, showcasing your mastery of advanced CSS techniques. The goal is to build a visually captivating and user-friendly website that reflects your restaurant's unique theme and ambiance.

**Scenario:**

Imagine you're about to open the restaurant you've always dreamed of. Your task is to design and develop a one-page website that will leave a lasting impression on potential customers. The website should not only provide essential information but also evoke the desired atmosphere and entice visitors to dine at your establishment.

**HTML Structure:**

Craft a well-structured HTML document (index.html) that includes the following elements:

*   **Essential Tags:** `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
*   **Headings:** Utilize `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags to organize content and highlight key sections like the restaurant name, menu categories, and other relevant information.
*   **Navigation:** Employ the `<nav>` element to create a user-friendly navigation menu with links to different sections of the website.
*   **Main Content:** Use the `<main>` tag to enclose the primary content area, which may include the menu, restaurant description, special offers, and more.
*   **Semantic Elements:** Leverage semantic HTML5 elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, and `<figcaption>` to provide structure and meaning to your content, enhancing accessibility and SEO.
*   **Text and Images:** Incorporate `<p>` tags for descriptive text and `<img>` tags to showcase enticing images of your restaurant's ambiance, dishes, and staff.
*   **Links:** Utilize `<a>` tags to create navigation links within the page and external links to relevant resources (e.g., social media profiles, online reservation systems).
*   **Interactive Elements:** Consider adding elements like buttons or other interactive components to enhance user engagement.

**CSS Styling:**

Create an external CSS file (style.css) and link it to your HTML document. Apply advanced CSS techniques to style the website elements and bring your vision to life:

*   **Layout:** Implement a sophisticated and responsive layout using either CSS Grid or Flexbox. Go beyond basic one or two-column structures to create a visually appealing and dynamic design.
*   **Typography and Colors:** Carefully select fonts, colors, and text sizes to establish a visual hierarchy and reflect your restaurant's theme.
*   **Backgrounds and Borders:** Utilize background images, colors, and borders to create visual interest and define sections within the page.
*   **Images:** Style images with appropriate sizing, positioning, and effects to showcase your restaurant's atmosphere and culinary delights.
*   **Advanced Selectors and Properties:** Employ pseudo-elements, attribute selectors, transitions, transforms, and animations to add interactive elements and visual flair.
*   **CSS Preprocessors (SASS):** Leverage SASS to write clean, maintainable, and reusable CSS code. Utilize variables, mixins, and nesting to streamline your styling process.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Write efficient CSS code, minimizing the use of `!important` and optimizing selectors for faster rendering.

**Creativity and Innovation:**

*   **Theme:** Choose a captivating theme for your restaurant and let it guide your design choices, from color palettes and typography to imagery and overall aesthetic.
*   **Visual Appeal:** Use high-quality images, CSS gradients, blend modes, and subtle animations to create a visually stunning and immersive experience.
*   **Advanced Typography:** Explore creative typography techniques like drop caps, custom fonts, or unique text layouts to add personality and flair.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Incorporate basic JavaScript interactions to enhance user engagement, such as toggling menu visibility or showcasing image carousels.
*   **Responsive Navigation:** Design a navigation menu that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on all devices.

**Bonus Challenges:**

*   **Contact Form:** Implement a simple contact form using HTML forms and basic CSS styling.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure your website adheres to accessibility guidelines, making it usable for individuals with disabilities.

**Submission:**

*   Utilize GitHub Classroom to submit your assignment.
*   Create two files in your repository: `index.html` (containing your HTML code) and `style.css` (containing your CSS code).
*   Push your code to the master/main branch to complete your submission.

**Resources:**

*   **Online Tutorials:** Refer to resources like WebDev for HTML and CSS tutorials.
*   **Color Palettes:** Explore color palettes from various designers or create your own using tools like Coolors.
*   **Code Editors:** Utilize online code editors like GitHub CodeSpaces or offline editors like WebStorm for a productive development environment.

**Remember:**

*   **Creativity is key!** There's no single right answer. Let your website reflect your unique vision and passion for your dream restaurant.
*   **Experiment and have fun!** This assignment is an opportunity to explore the boundaries of your CSS skills and create something truly remarkable.
*   **Seek help if needed!** Don't hesitate to ask your instructor or classmates for assistance if you encounter challenges.

**Embrace this challenge and let your creativity shine through your code!**
